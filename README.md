SOLID design principles help resolve these issues by decoupling software programs. Robert C. Martin introduced these concepts in his paper titled Design Principles and Design Patterns, and Michael Feathers came up with the acronym later.

  The SOLID design principle includes these five principles:

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

Its to be noted that the SOLID design principle can not always be applied, so don't take it as rules but use it instead as a guidelines.
