# In above code when there will be need for extension in future we might need to do changes in same class again and again

# So this code not only lack scalability, itâ€™s also breaking the open close principle.
# A well written class should not have to be re-written in order to integrate a new feature like having an address.

# See report.rb file for better understanding of OCP.
