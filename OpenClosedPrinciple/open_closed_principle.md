The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that 

### **“Modules, classes, methods and other application entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.”**

In simple terms all modules, classes, methods, etc. should be designed in a modular way so that you anyone can be able to change the behavior of the system without changing the source code.

Following the open-closed principle, developers create a flexible system architecture that can be easily modified and extended. This is important because software projects often require changes to meet new customer needs. By designing with flexibility in mind, developers can make updates and add features without major code rewrites. This ensures the software can adapt to future requirements and provide an improved experience for users.
